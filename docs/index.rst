Main advice: Do not distribute state over multiple layers. CoAP unfortunately
has many cross-layer dependencies if you divide processing in more than the
Message and Req/Res layers. Especially observe is critical here. I am going to
introduce Exchange objects in Cf, which will contain all relevant information
for a request/response pair in one place. These will be passed through the
stack, which will become a pure processing pipeline then.
 
Another thing that often causes headaches is client/server symmetry in the
stack. It might be easier to follow HTTP here and have a dedicated stack for
client behavior and for server behavior. I prefer, however, to have all
block-related code for instance in a single place, i.e., layer. Thus, I will
stick to the symmetric design.
 
The last issue I can think of is multi-threading. If you want to include
cross-proxy functionality, check out the Python libraries first, e.g., for
HTTP. They often come with their own thread pools which can make your own
worker thread design quite uglyâ€¦ Plan from the beginning where to dispatch,
etc.
